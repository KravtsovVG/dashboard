## New Project Base

A starting point for your next project:
* Laravel 5.2
* Angular
* Bootstrap, with an off-the-shelf theme so it should be easily replacable
* Google Auth for signup and login
* Forgot password, etc...
* Simple models and views for projects and users
* Ability to invite users to projects and assign owner status

This is a compilation of other projects, but any new material in this is open-sourced under [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so feel free to use it as a starting point for your own projects!
